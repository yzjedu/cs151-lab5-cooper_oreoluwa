Objective:

What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?

- We were supposed to get practice with designing and programming loops, testing code, and error checking

Procedure:

What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?

- We used loops and various 'if' statements to make sure the output would be what we wanted

What were the Key concepts explored?

- Loops, error checking, and various other aspects of Python we've learned so far

Results:

Did your results match what you expected to get?

- Eventually, the results did match what I expected

Reflection:

What challenges did you encounter?

- Figuring out where to start the loop was probably the most difficult challenge I encountered

How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?

- I planned out what to do before I coded, I made sure to add comments to explain what each piece of code did, and I did a lot of testing, which is practice

Did you overcome them, and how?

- I did, mainly through consulting with the professor and my partner

Any key takeaways?

- Many things we can use in everyday life, such as ATMs, work because of complex code.

Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?

- I think I learned what I was supposed to learn.

What was it like working with your partner?

- It wasn't too bad. We had some difficulty meeting up to discuss the assignment, but that's not her fault. I had a busy week, and I'm sure it was the same for her.
