The primary objective of this lab was to design and implement a simulation of an ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) 
that allows users to view their balance, deposit money, and withdraw funds. I aimed to enhance my understanding of loops, 
error checking, and overall programming logic in Python. By the end of the lab, I hoped to create a functional program that 
effectively handled user inputs and performed the necessary calculations while providing a smooth user experience.


The procedure involved several key steps. First, I began by outlining the functionality of the ATM, including the options available
to the user, such as deposit, withdraw, view balance, and exit. After designing the program's logic, I moved on to coding the 
simulation in Python, focusing on user input handling and balance calculations. A significant aspect of the implementation was 
incorporating error checking to manage invalid inputs, negative amounts, and balance constraints. Finally,
I created various test cases to verify the functionality of the program and ensure its robustness in different scenarios.

During this process, I explored several key concepts, including user input handling, conditional statements for decision-making, 
loops for continuous operation until exit, and error checking to enhance the user experience. 
These concepts were crucial in creating a reliable and user-friendly ATM simulation.


The results of the lab matched my expectations. The ATM correctly handled deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries, 
functioning as intended. I utilized various test cases, including both normal and extreme scenarios, 
such as attempting to withdraw more than the available balance. This thorough testing allowed me to confirm the program's 
reliability and its ability to respond appropriately to different user inputs.

Throughout the lab, I encountered several challenges. One of the main difficulties was implementing robust error checking, 
particularly ensuring that negative values were handled correctly without causing the program to crash. 
Additionally, managing user input and ensuring that the program could gracefully handle unexpected entries 
required careful planning and attention to detail. In following the first three rules of programming, I focused on keeping 
the code simple and straightforward to enhance usability. I also tested the program early and often, 
creating test cases throughout the development process to catch errors quickly. After initial testing, 
I revisited the code to refactor and improve its readability. By breaking down the problem into smaller parts, addressing 
each challenge individually and seeking help from my professor, I was able to overcome difficulties and create a functional ATM simulation.

My key takeaways from this experience include the importance of thorough testing and clear logic in programming.
Testing aids in identifying edge cases and ensuring a smooth user experience, while well-structured code enhances readability 
and maintainability. Overall, I believe I successfully learned the intended concepts from this lab, particularly in handling
user inputs and performing error checks.

Working with my partner was a valuable experience. He was really accommodating of my circumstances, and we were able to successfully complete
the lab together. Our collaboration not only improved our project but also enhanced my understanding of the concepts involved.
